# ENPM661_Project3
ENPM661 Planning for Autonomous Robots <br /> 
Project3 on A* Algorithm Implementation

# Instructions

1. Make sure cv2 library in installed
2. Run Varith_Punturaumporn.py
3. The program will display map with blue obstracles (before inflated)
4. The program will ask for robot radius
5. Input positive value for robot radius, else the program will ask for new radius
6. The program will ask for clearance between robot and obstracles
7. Input positive value for clearance, else the program will ask for new clearance
8. The program will display map with blue obstracles and green inflated area 
9. The program will ask for start and goal node
10. Input start and goal node in command line, seperate x and y values by space
11. If inputs are out of map or are inside obstacles, the program will ask for new nodes
12. The program will ask for step size
13. Input step size between 1 to 10, else the program will ask for new step size
14. The search begins, start and goal nodes are displayed in red circles, and explored paths are displayed in white
15. If the goal is visited, the program will draw an optimal path from start to goal node in red and print "Success"
16. If path is not found, the program will print "Failure"
